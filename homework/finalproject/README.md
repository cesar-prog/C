# FINAL PROJECT: LIBRARY AND DATA
> Library and data is a software where you can search an autor and scripts with extra information to promote the reading and the guest could be interested in reading.
> 
## PROJECT PLAN
My project would have
* **TIME**: To have a notion of when you use the file
* **Select one author, then you can also select an script**
* When you select an script the file will show you many options...
> 1 - How many pages the script have
>> 2 - A overview (Describe in writing what the book is about)
>> 3 - Editorial
>>4 - Check it (Shows you a link to buy the book)
>> 5 - Go back /*this would be to go to the previous page*/ (It is just an idea, I am not sure if this would be in the final project at the end)
