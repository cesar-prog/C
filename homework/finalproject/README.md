## PROJECT PLAN
My project would have
* **TIME**: To have a notion of when you use the file
* **Select one book, then you can also select the info that are you looking for**
* When you select an script the file will show you many options...*

1 - How many pages the script have

2 - A overview (Describe in writing what the book is about)

3 - Check it (Shows you a link to buy the book)

4 - Go back /*this would be to go to the previous page*/
